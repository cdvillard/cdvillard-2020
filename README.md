## On why I'm doing this

I've decided it's about time that I redesign my website and bring it up to snuff. My old site was perfectly fine, and my old, old website did the job, but wasn't something <strong>I</strong> had built. It was really a bunch of tweaks based on a theme, and while it served its purpose, I'd like to I say I had built something from scratch and inspiration rather than tweak more themes. So I'm going to take Ethan Marcotte's advice about [letting a website be a worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/) and start refreshing my website.

## On what I'm doing this for

I'm doing this partially for my own edification, partially for self-promotion, and partially because I need to vent some pressure while living through the [COVID-19 pandemic that's gripped the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic). For now, we'll focus on my edification.

Since I built the first version of my personal website, many new technologies have come around advancing the field of web development. I've gotten to play with a few of them, but not really delve into them as much as I'd like to. Again, taking Ethan's advice, I'm going to turn this website over and over until I like it. Then, I'll keep turning it over and over some more.

I'm hoping to learn a few things while building this. This will be a living list:

[] CSS Grid
[] Accessible design
[] Advanced responsive design and layout
[] Service workers and PWAs

I'm hoping to blog all of this and keep it going as well. Let's see where this goes.
